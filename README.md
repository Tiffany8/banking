# üè¶ Banking API

## Getting Started

### Requirements:
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

### Running the Application:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Tiffany8/Banking.git
    cd Banking
    ```

2. Build and start the services:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build app
    ```

3. Access the server via [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).  See [API Documentation](#api-documentation) for more help; but for commandline access, I like to use [http](www.httpie.com)
  ```bash
  http localhost:8080/transfers
  ```

  ```bash
  http localhost:8080/transfers/${ID}
  ```

  ```bash
  http --json POST localhost:8080/accounts customer_id=${customer_id} account_number=${account_number} routing_number=${valid_routing_number} 
  ```

### Running the Tests:
1. Execute tests:
    ```bash
    docker-compose run --build test
    ```

## API Documentation

Access Swagger documentation at [http://localhost:8080/docs](http://localhost:8080/docs) when the server is running.

## Pain Points/Frustrations:

- **SQLite3**:
   - Lack of native async/await support led to verbose code while wrapping SQLite's callback-based API in Promises.
   - Adapting to SQLite-specific SQL syntax and conventions posed challenges, especially the absence of common SQL functions like CONCAT.
   - The mix of synchronous and asynchronous methods added complexity, especially when integrating with an asynchronous environment like Fastify.
   - Lack of built-in UUID data type, however, it is flexible enough to allow for the storage of UUIDs, so overall, code would be more verbose because UUIDs need to be generated in the application code
   - In the application, I realized later that the ids in the seed data were actually uuids. I created the table ids as autoincrementing integers. 

- **Error Handling**: 
   - Floating promises led to unhandled promise rejections, complicating debugging.

- **Schema Validation**:
   - I'd used Zod previously and recall having some difficulties with it, so was curious about Yup for schema validation. I found Yup less minimalist. Sparse documentation on integrating `fastify-yup-swagger` posed challenges, but I stumbled upon recent `fastify-type-provider` for [Yup](https://github.com/jorgevrgs/fastify-type-provider-yup) that simplified the Swagger setup. Considering exploring Typebox next.
        - Encountered a limitation where the library doesn't support accurate representation of arrays of specific object schemas (see /transfers endpoint schema)
        - Also, adding `example`, `description`, and `label` on Yup objects is valid for Swagger API documentation but are not actual attributes on Yup objects, so test fail.
   - Configuring Swagger UI for API documentation was challenging

- **ESLint Configuration in VSCode**:
   - I had to tweak and update ESLint settings in VSCode as initial settings weren't sufficiently customized for node projects, leading to some eslint-ignore statements in the code.

- **Logging**:
   - The current logging setup lacks adequate information for effective debugging.

## Future Directions:

- **Error Handling Improvements**:
   - Plan to implement a global error handler for catching unhandled errors and rejections.

- **Logging Enhancements**:
   - Aim to incorporate a centralized logging system like ELK Stack for better observability.

- **CI/CD Setup**:
   - Will set up a CI/CD pipeline for automating testing and deployment, ensuring a reliable delivery process.

- **Monitoring and Alerting**:
   - Intend to implement monitoring and alerting tools for proactive issue detection.

- **Docker Setup**:
   - Plan to decrease the Dockerfile size by employing a multi-stage setup where only compiled files are copied into the image.

- **Pagination Enhancements**:
   - Include `offset`, `limit`, and `count` parameters in the response to provide clearer pagination information.
   - Potentially transition to cursor-based pagination for a more scalable and user-friendly pagination experience.
